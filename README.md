### Hi👋, I'm Rijin!
I'm a Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo who really loves working on complex projects in the field of robotics and embedded software!

- 📚 Currently, I'm learning FreeRTOS, Go, Rust and exploring various concepts in controls software. 
- 🛠️ Check out my latest project! I built a [Self Balancing Robot](https://github.com/rijin113/Self_Balancing_Robot) on the STM32! It uses a finite state machine, a PID controller and a custom [I2C driver](https://github.com/rijin113/MPU6050_I2C_Driver) that I made to interface with the robot's IMU.

In terms of my past experiences, I have interned at
- ⚡  [onsemi](https://www.onsemi.com/) as a Firmware developer in the Mobile, Cloud, and Computing division,
- ✈️  [Avidrone](https://avidrone.com/) as an Embedded Software Developer working on Unmanned Aircraft Systems,
- 💡  [Infinera](https://www.infinera.com/) as a Firmware Engineer working on DSP firmware & SDK
